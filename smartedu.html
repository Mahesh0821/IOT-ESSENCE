                        <strong> Develop a smart solution to make a teacher's life easier in managing class attendance. <br></strong> Taking attendance of the class while managing it is a hectic task for any teacher as there are numerous         
                        disturbances along with various discrepancies occurring simultaneously. This often affects the quality of 
                        the class as the teacher cannot completely concentrate on academic deliveries. An attendance management 
                        system can save time and reduce errors. It can streamline the attendance process and make it more efficient 
                        for teachers while also providing valuable data and insights to help improve the quality of the class.
